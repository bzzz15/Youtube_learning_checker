### 1. Project Components

1. Video Tracking and Management:
   - Implemented video addition with categories and priority settings.
   - Features to add videos, store details in an Excel workbook, and display them in a GUI.

2. Transcript Extraction and Topic Extraction:
   - Integrated transcript extraction using YouTubeTranscriptApi and yt_dlp.
   - Using spaCy and transformers for topic and keyword extraction.

3. User Profile Management:
   - Maintaining user profiles with video data and topics using a JSON file.
   - The profile management system is connected to the video tracking system.

4. Interactive Chatbot:
   - Chatbot integration mentioned but not yet implemented.
   - Will involve creating and integrating a chatbot framework like Rasa or Dialogflow.

5. Visualization and Reporting:
   - Planned to use libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
   - This functionality isn't present in the current code and needs to be added.

### 2. Project Workflow

1. Setup and Initialization: Completed.
2. Video Addition: Implemented.
3. Transcript and Topic Extraction: Implemented.
4. Profile Management: Implemented.
5. Chatbot Integration: Not started.
6. Visualization and Reporting: Not started.

### 3. Implementation Steps

1. Set Up the Development Environment: Complete.
2. Develop Core Features: Core features are mostly done.
3. Enhance User Profiles: Implemented.
4. Build and Integrate Chatbot: Needs to be done.
5. Implement Visualization: Needs to be done.
6. Testing and Refinement: Should be the next step.
7. Deployment: Pending, once everything is tested and refined.

### Next Steps

1. Chatbot Integration: Start by selecting a chatbot framework and integrating it into the application.
2. Visualization and Reporting: Implement features to generate and display visual reports and graphs.
3. Testing and Refinement: Test all functionalities, including new features, and refine the application based on feedback.
4. Deployment: Prepare for deployment, which may include packaging the application into an executable form.

Overall, I'm well on my way. Next, I will focus on integrating the chatbot and adding visualization features.
